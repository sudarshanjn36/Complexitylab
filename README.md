# ComplexityLab

**ComplexityLab** is a Python package for empirically analyzing **time** and **space complexity** of algorithms.  
It allows you to run an algorithm with different input sizes, measure runtime and peak memory usage, and collect results for further analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Features (Day 1)
- Run any function with generated input of different sizes.
- Measure **runtime** in seconds.
- Measure **peak memory usage** in bytes.
- Return results in a clean table (list of dictionaries).
- Organized as a Python package for easy extension.
